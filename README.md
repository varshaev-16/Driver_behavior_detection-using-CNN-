# Driver_behavior_detection-using-CNN-

Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying driver behaviors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging image data from the 'RevItsOne 5-Class Driver Behavior Dataset,' the model identifies different driving activities such as talking on the phone, turning, and other potentially dangerous behaviors.


Objective

The goal is to develop an automated system that accurately classifies various driver behaviors to enhance road safety.


Approach

Data Collection: Utilized the 'RevItsOne 5-Class Driver Behavior Dataset' from Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing: Images were resized and normalized for consistency.
Model Architecture: A CNN model with multiple convolutional layers was designed to classify driver behaviors.
Training & Evaluation: The model was trained on the preprocessed images and validated using a separate test set.

Results

The CNN model achieved a validation accuracy of 97.9%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time driver behavior detection.


Conclusion

This project provides a robust solution for monitoring driver behavior, contributing to improved road safety through real-time classification.
